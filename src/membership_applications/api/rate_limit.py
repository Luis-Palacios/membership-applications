# --- Per-user rate limiting on the verified JWT `sub` ---
#
# Layering note: this only ever sees requests that already passed JWT verification, so it is the
# *application* layer -- fairness and abuse control per authenticated user. It deliberately does
# NOT limit anonymous traffic by IP; floods and brute-force against unauthenticated endpoints belong
# at the edge (Cloudflare rate-limit rule, AWS WAF rate-based rule on the ALB -- see
# DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP Phase 8.5). REVISIT before exposing this API publicly (e.g. for a mobile app):
# a per-IP layer becomes necessary then, and a client IP is only trustworthy once the origin
# accepts traffic solely from Cloudflare (CF-Connecting-IP).
#
# Storage comes from RATE_LIMIT_STORAGE_URI, so moving from per-process memory to a shared Redis
# is configuration, not code. With the default memory:// store, counters live in this process only:
# with ApiSettings.workers > 1, or multiple replicas, each process keeps its own, so a limit like
# "60/minute" effectively becomes "60 x (workers x replicas) per minute". Fine at 1 worker / 1
# replica; switch to a shared store before relying on this as a real global guarantee.
#
# Moving-window is the exact algorithm (no burst at window edges, unlike fixed-window) and at
# 10-60 hits per user per window its memory cost is negligible; swap the strategy class here if a
# much larger limit ever makes that cost matter.
