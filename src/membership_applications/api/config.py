    # BETTER_AUTH_URL origin *exactly*, i.e. the PUBLIC url (https://staff.example.org in prod),
    # which differs from auth_server_url once the fetch goes over an internal address. All three
    # are kept as plain str rather than pydantic's AnyUrl, since AnyUrl normalizes a bare origin
    # by *adding* a trailing slash, which would silently break every iss/aud comparison.

    # replica count once this runs as multiple containers. Each worker also
    # gets its own in-memory rate-limiter counters -- see the warning in
    # rate_limit.py -- so a "10/minute" limit effectively becomes
    # "10 x workers per minute", silently, with no error to signal it.
    # Once deployed behind an orchestrator (ECS/K8s), prefer scaling via
    # replica count and leave this at 1 -- the orchestrator can health-check

    # by workers x replicas for the real total. If this is smaller than
    # db_pool_size + db_max_overflow, *this* becomes the binding concurrency
    # limit for sync DB-backed routes instead of the DB pool; if it's
    # larger, the DB pool stays the bottleneck and raising this further has
    # no effect. Applied in main.py's lifespan startup hook (not passed to
